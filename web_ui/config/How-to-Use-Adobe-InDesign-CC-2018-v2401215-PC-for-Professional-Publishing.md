## How to Use Alternate Layout
 
Alternate Layout is a handy feature that helps you create multiple versions of your layout for different page sizes, orientations or devices. For example, you can create a layout for a print magazine and then use Alternate Layout to create a different layout for a tablet or a smartphone.
 
To use Alternate Layout, follow these steps:

1. Open your InDesign document and select the Pages panel.
2. Click on the Create Alternate Layout button at the bottom of the panel.
3. In the dialog box that appears, choose the options for your alternate layout, such as page size, orientation, layout name and liquid page rule.
4. Click OK to create the alternate layout.
5. You can now edit the alternate layout as you wish. You can also use the Page tool to resize or reposition the pages in the alternate layout.
6. To switch between the original layout and the alternate layout, use the Layout menu or the Pages panel.

## How to Use Linked Content
 
Linked Content is a useful feature that allows you to link assets, pages and documents together, so that when you make changes to one of them, the changes are automatically applied to all of them. This way, you can ensure consistency and accuracy across your project and save time.
 
To use Linked Content, follow these steps:

1. Select the asset, page or document that you want to link in your InDesign document.

6. To update the linked content manually, select it and choose Edit > Update Link from the menu bar.

## How to Use Split Window
 
Split Window is a convenient feature that lets you compare layouts side by side in the same document window. For example, you can use Split Window to compare your original layout and your alternate layout or to compare two different versions of your layout.
 
To use Split Window, follow these steps:

1. Select the document window that you want to split in your InDesign document.
2. Choose Window > Arrange > Split Window from the menu bar.
3. You will see two panes in your document window. You can drag the divider between them to adjust their size.
